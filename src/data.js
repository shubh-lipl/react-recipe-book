It is decorated with additional whipped cream, maraschino cherries, and chocolate shavings. In some European traditions, sour cherries are used both between the layers and for decorating the top. Traditionally, kirschwasser, a clear spirit made from sour cherries, is added to the cake. Other spirits are sometimes used, such as rum, which is common in Austrian recipes. German law mandates that any dessert labeled Schwarzw√§lder Kirschtorte must have kirschwasser.'

  name: ' Chelsea bun',
  detail: 'The Chelsea bun is a type of currant bun that was first baked in the 18th century at the Bun House in Chelsea,[1] an establishment favoured by Hanoverian royalty. The shop was demolished in 1839. The bun is made of a rich yeast dough flavoured with lemon peel, cinnamon or mixed spice.[2] Before being rolled into a square spiral shape, the dough is spread with a mixture of currants, brown sugar and butter. The process of making this bun is very similar to that involved in producing the cinnamon roll. After being baked, traditionally the chelsea bun is glazed with syrup (or cold water and sugar). It is glazed while still hot so that the water evaporates and leaves a sticky sugar glaze, making the bun much sweeter.'
